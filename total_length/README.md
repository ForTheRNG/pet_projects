# What it do
Little script that takes a folder containing your music and calculates total length, to use if unsure how long you can listen to music without it repeating.

# Usage
Install Node if you don't have it already. Then, from CLI, run length.js, with the root path as an argument. Example:
node length.js C:\Music
