        <title>AO3 RSS generator</title>
    </head>

        Does what it says on the tin: generates RSS feeds for AO3 works and series.
        <br><br>
        How to use:<ol>
            <li>Get the AO3 work's link (like https://archiveofourown.org/works/9876543210/).</li>
            <li>Isolate the relevant bit and add a little "ao3" in front (like /ao3/works/9876543210/).</li>
            <li>Paste it after this page's address (like http://somedomain.com/ao3/works/9876543210/).</li>
            <li>That link should give you an XML with all the required data! As in, your RSS
            aggregator just needs the last link.</li>
        </ol>
        Same for series, really! Just isolate something along the lines of "/ao3/series/9876543210".
        <br><br>
        Note: Only feed one work/series at a time. Unfortunately, I am not smart enough to overlap a lot of feeds. Sorry.
        <br><br>
        Note: This program uses page crawling, and as such is fairly vulnerable to internal changes in the HTML. Hopefully
        that doesn't happen anytime soon, but who knows.

        You can grab the source code <a href="/sourcecode">here</a>! If you somehow stumble in here
        and have a server you use for yourself, hosting there should make your RSS feed more reliable since
        you control when the server is on! (You'll require Node to run the server, but probably no additional modules.)
        (Please read the source code so you don't just start running worms, backdoors & who knows what else. It's not that
        long.)
